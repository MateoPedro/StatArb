# Market-Neutral Crypto Strategy

This repository houses the implementation of a comprehensive, research-driven, market-neutral cryptocurrency strategy that exploits the dynamics of matching-period intraday momentum and potential reversals. The strategy's design is guided by optimal Sharpe weighting to effectively balance the identified reversal and momentum strategies.

## Features

- **Matching-period Intraday Momentum Exploitation:** The strategy leverages research methodologies to exploit the dynamics of intraday momentum in the crypto markets.

- **Potential Reversal Identification:** Harnesses comprehensive research to anticipate potential market reversals, providing a more robust strategy.

- **Market-Neutral Design:** The strategy is built to be market-neutral, reducing exposure to overall market movements and focusing on relative performance.

- **Optimal Sharpe Weighting:** The balance of reversal and momentum strategies is optimized based on their Sharpe ratios, enabling effective risk-adjusted performance.

## Usage

This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file that houses the implementation of the strategy. Simply clone the repository and open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment to explore the strategy.

## Results

The strategy has been extensively backtested over a 3-year period across 10 diverse cryptocurrencies, demonstrating its robust performance with a compelling Sharpe ratio of 2.03, a maximum drawdown of 8.66%, and a 2.05 alpha t-stat.
